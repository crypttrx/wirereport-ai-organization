        self.content_engine = content_engine
        self.rate_limiter = rate_limiter

    def coordinate(self):
        if self.rate_limiter.allow_request():
            content = self.content_engine.generate_content()
            self.queue_manager.enqueue(content)

class ContentEngine:
    def __init__(self, trend_analyzer, sentiment_monitor):
        self.trend_analyzer = trend_analyzer
        self.sentiment_monitor = sentiment_monitor

    def generate_content(self):
        trends = self.trend_analyzer.analyze()
        sentiment = self.sentiment_monitor.monitor()
        return self.create_content(trends, sentiment)

    def create_content(self, trends, sentiment):
        # Generate content based on analysis
        return f"Trending News: {trends}, Audience Sentiment: {sentiment}"
```

### API Endpoint Designs

#### Example FastAPI Design
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/content")
async def get_content():
    # Fetch content from the database or cache
    return {"content": "Latest sports news"}

@app.post("/enqueue")
async def enqueue_content(content: str):
    # Add content to the queue
    return {"status": "Content enqueued successfully"}
```

### Database Schemas

```sql
CREATE TABLE tweet_analytics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    account_id INT,
    tweet_id VARCHAR(255),
    engagement_rate FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_engagement_rate ON tweet_analytics (engagement_rate);
```

### Queue Message Formats

#### JSON Message Format
```json
{
    "account": "wirereportnfl",
    "content": "Exciting game highlights from last night's match!",
    "priority": "high",
    "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```
