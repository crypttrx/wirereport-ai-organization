# 🛡️ Wire Report Anti-Hallucination System

## The Problem
Wire Report was posting HALLUCINATED content that damaged credibility:
- Asia Durr with 26.5 PPG (unverified stat) 
- Asia Durr with #LibertyLoud (doesn't play for Liberty)
- Candace Parker "trade rumors" with Sky (she retired)
- NBA teams posted in WNBA queue
- Made-up statistics and false team associations

## The Solution: Trending-Based Content Model

### 1. **90% Trending-Based Content** (Like @wirereportnba)
- **Trending Content Harvester Agent**: Pulls REAL tweets with verified engagement
- **Content Types**:
  - 35% Replies to trending tweets
  - 30% Quote tweets of viral content  
  - 25% Content inspired by trends
  - 5% Historical facts
  - 5% Game recaps

### 2. **Enhanced Senior Editor Agent**
```python
async def check_for_hallucinations(self, tweet_data: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Check for potential hallucinations in content"""
    
    # Checks for:
    - Unverified statistics (26.5 PPG without source)
    - Incorrect team associations (Asia Durr + Liberty)
    - Unsourced trade/signing news
    - Future predictions as facts
    - Unverified time-sensitive claims
```

### 3. **Verification Requirements**
Every tweet now includes metadata:
```json
{
  "verified_content": true,      // From trending source
  "source_tweet_id": "123456",   // Original tweet
  "parent_author": "@espn",      // Credible source
  "no_hallucination": true,      // Passed all checks
  "copyright_safe": true         // Media verified
}
```

### 4. **Production Pipeline Changes**

#### OLD (Problematic):
```
AI generates content → Post
(No verification, hallucinations common)
```

#### NEW (Safe):
```
Harvest trending → Generate based on real content → 
Senior Editor review → Hallucination check → 
Copyright check → Viral prediction → Post
```

## Implementation

### Core Agents Created:
1. **Trending Content Harvester** - Backbone of content
2. **Enhanced Senior Editor** - Hallucination detection
3. **Media Copyright Guardian** - DMCA prevention
4. **Viral Content Predictor** - Engagement optimization
