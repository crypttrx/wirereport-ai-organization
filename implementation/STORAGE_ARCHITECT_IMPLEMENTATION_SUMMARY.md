## Usage Examples

### Basic Database Registration
```python
from intelligence.agents.storage_architect import get_storage_architect, DatabaseConfig, StorageType, DataTier

architect = get_storage_architect()

# Register a new database
config = DatabaseConfig(
    name="analytics_db",
    type=StorageType.DATA_WAREHOUSE,
    connection_string="sqlite:///analytics.db",
    max_connections=100,
    tier=DataTier.WARM
)

success = architect.register_database(config)
```

### Schema Creation and Optimization
```python
from intelligence.agents.storage_architect import TableSchema, IndexType

# Define optimized schema
schema = TableSchema(
    name="player_performance",
    columns={
        "id": "UUID PRIMARY KEY",
        "player_id": "VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL",
        "performance_date": "DATE NOT NULL",
        "efficiency_rating": "DECIMAL(5,2)"
    },
    primary_key=["id"],
    indexes=[
        {"columns": ["player_id", "performance_date"], "type": "composite"}
    ],
    tier=DataTier.HOT
)

architect.create_database_schema("analytics_db", schema)
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Monitor database performance
metrics = architect.monitor_database_performance("analytics_db")

# Generate performance report
report = architect.generate_performance_report("analytics_db", hours=24)

# Get storage overview
overview = architect.get_storage_overview()
```

### Global Optimization
```python
from intelligence.agents.storage_architect import optimize_all_databases, create_unified_storage_architecture

# Optimize all registered databases
optimization_results = optimize_all_databases()

# Create unified architecture across all systems
unified_arch = create_unified_storage_architecture()
```
