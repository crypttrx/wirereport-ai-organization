## Separation from Code

All organizational planning documents have been moved to this standalone folder to:
1. **Clean Code Base**: Keep `/root/wirereport/` focused on actual code
2. **Organized Planning**: Group all strategic documents together
3. **Easy Reference**: Single location for all organizational materials
4. **Version Control**: Track organizational evolution separately

## Usage

To reference organizational documents:
```bash
cd /root/wirereport_organization
# Browse governance, consensus, implementation, logs
```

Code repository remains at:
```bash
cd /root/wirereport
# Pure code, no organizational documents
```
