## 8. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Deploy Board of Directors agents
- Establish C-suite executive agents
- Implement basic communication protocols
- Set up performance tracking

### Phase 2: Operations (Week 2)
- Deploy committee structures
- Implement decision authority matrix
- Establish escalation procedures
- Begin autonomous operations

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3-4)
- Refine decision-making processes
- Optimize communication flows
- Implement performance improvements
- Validate full autonomy

### Phase 4: Scale (Month 2)
- Expand to 10+ leagues
- Stress test governance structure
- Optimize for 1000+ tweets/day
- Validate $10K+ MRR operations

This governance structure enables WireReport to operate as a fully autonomous AI corporation generating $1M+ ARR with minimal human oversight.
